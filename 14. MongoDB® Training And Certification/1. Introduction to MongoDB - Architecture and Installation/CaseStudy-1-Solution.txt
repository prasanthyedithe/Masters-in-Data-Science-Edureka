2. The most widely used non-relational database, MongoDB, accommodates semi-structured documents by natively storing them in the JSON format.
3. For Unstructured data we will go with NoSQL like MongoDB as data that comes doesn’t have any pre-defined structure to it and comes in all its diversity of forms.
