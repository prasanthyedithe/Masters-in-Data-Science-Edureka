# What is the probability of getting a 2 or a 5 when a die is rolled? 
To find the probability of getting 2 or 5 on the face when a die is rolled. We can do this by using the formula of probability.

P(E) = (Number of times event occurs)/(Total number of trials)

Sample space of possible outcomes on rolling a die is  S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

If event E is the probability of getting 2 or 5 as outcome on rolling a die.  

Number of times event occurs [n(E)] = 2
