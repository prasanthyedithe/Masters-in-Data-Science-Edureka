Part 1 - reading and analysing data
# Load data
# str of data frame 
# print first 5 rows of data frame
# find count of missing values in every column
# how many female and how many males were travelling
#R Code to find the percentage of passengers who survived
#R Code to find the percentage of first class passenger who survive
# R Code to find the number of female/male all class passengers who survived
#R Code to find the percentage of female survivors from all classes

#Transform passenger names from factor variables to character variables
# Transform survived and passenger class from integers to factor variables:


#R Code to count the number of first-class passengers who survived the sinking of the Titanic.
#Create a 3-way table for the variables `survived` (passengers' survival; 0=No, 1=Yes), `pclass` (passenger class; 1=Upper class, 2=Middle class, 3=Lower class) and `sex` (male and female).
#Display the five-number summaries  
# make a histogram plots for `age` (passengers' age) and `fare` (passengers' fare in pounds):
#Display the frequency tables for `sibsp` (number of siblings or spouses aboard Titanic) 
and `embarked` (port of embarkation; C=Cherbourg, Q=Queenstown, S=Southampton).
#Inspect the data for unusual patterns like find passengers travelled on zero fare.
#find name of passengers who paid the most expensive fare ans should be 512.33 pounds.
# number of passengers that paid max fare and print names of the 4 passengers
#print passengers who had at least 6 family members on board, with their names.
# print number of unique tickets
# number of tickets (bottom row) shared by number of passengers (top row)
# print names of tickets that had at least 6 passengers sharing it
# print names of the 86 passengers who shared the tickets: 
# identify the passengers whose age were NA/ missing
# find count of male passengers in the lower class
# calculate the median age for all male passengers in the lower class
# assign any 2 male passengers to be 24 years old 
# identify the passengers whose fare was NA
# how many passengers in the lower class i.e pclass 3
# find the median fare of the lower class tickets
# assign the median fare to the NA fare value
