# ML-Model-for-Auto-Insurance-Industry

# Aim of the Project
The  aim  of  the  project  is  to build  a  Machine  Learning Model to predict whether an owner will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year

# Dataset Description
The  project  involves  the use  of  a  dataset  with  600k  training  data  and  59 columns.In  the train and test data, features that belong to similar groupings are tagged as such in the feature names  (e.g.,  ind,  reg,  car,  calc).  In  addition,  feature  names  include  the  postfix  bin  to indicate binary  features  and  cat  to  indicate  categorical  features.  Features  without  these  designations are  either  continuous  or  ordinal.  Values  of -1  indicate  that  the  feature  was  missing  from  the observation. The target column signifieswhethera claim was filed for that policy holder
